DAO Layer
Connection Management:

Ensure DBConnection is using a connection pool for efficiency.
All database resources (ResultSet, PreparedStatement, Connection) are properly closed using try-with-resources.
Error Handling:

Ensure all SQLExceptions are caught or logged meaningfully.
Service Layer
Business Logic Isolation:

Confirm that the service layer contains all business logic and the DAO layer is strictly for database interactions.
Validation:

Check input validation for addBook, updateBook, etc., to prevent invalid data from being saved.
Servlets
Single Responsibility:

Each servlet should have one clear purpose (e.g., handling user registration, managing books).
Input Handling:

Validate all user inputs (e.g., null/empty checks, length constraints).
Prevent injection attacks by ensuring inputs are sanitized.
Error Handling:

Use appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors).
Provide meaningful error messages on both client and server sides.
JSP Pages
JSTL and EL Usage:

Check for proper usage of JSTL and EL to avoid scriptlets (<% ... %>).
Ensure error/success messages are displayed dynamically.
Responsive Design:

Use CSS or frameworks like Bootstrap for user-friendly and responsive design.
Unit Tests
Coverage:

Ensure all key DAO and Service methods have unit tests.
Write tests for edge cases (e.g., adding a book with invalid data, deleting a non-existent record).
Mocking:

Verify DAO methods are mocked in service tests and dependencies are isolated.
3. Configuration Files
web.xml:

Check for accurate servlet mappings.
Ensure security configurations, if any, are set up (e.g., login forms, role-based access).
DBConnection:

Verify database credentials are loaded securely (e.g., using environment variables).
Use a properties/config file for database settings.
pom.xml:

Ensure all required dependencies are included:
Servlets API.
JSTL.
JUnit, Mockito (for testing).
Check for unused dependencies and remove them.
4. Functional Review
Core Features
User Registration and Login:

Confirm the user can register and log in.
Passwords should be hashed (use libraries like Bcrypt).
Profile Management:

Users can view and edit their profile.
Book Management:

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) work as expected.
Input validation prevents invalid data from being saved.
List and Search:

Books are listed in a user-friendly table.
Search and filtering features (if implemented) are accurate.
Error Scenarios
Attempt to update/delete a book that doesnâ€™t exist.
Handle invalid input gracefully without server crashes.
Show appropriate error messages when the database is unavailable.
5. Security
Input Validation and Sanitization:

Ensure all inputs are validated on both client and server sides.
Password Security:

Use strong hashing algorithms like Bcrypt for storing passwords.
Avoid storing plaintext passwords.
SQL Injection Prevention:

Use prepared statements in all database queries.
Session Management:

Ensure sessions are used securely (e.g., session timeouts, HTTPS-only cookies).
6. Performance
Use a connection pool for database connections.
Optimize SQL queries for better performance.
Consider caching frequently accessed data (if needed).
7. Documentation
Code Comments:

Ensure classes, methods, and key logic are documented with meaningful comments.
README File:

Add a README.md file that includes:
Project description.
Setup instructions (database setup, running the project).
Dependencies and build instructions.
Features list.
Known issues (if any).
API Documentation:

Document all endpoints (e.g., URL, method, input/output format).
8. Deployment
Environment Setup:

Test deployment on a Tomcat server or similar.
Ensure the database is properly configured.
Testing:

Perform end-to-end testing in a staging environment.
Check for cross-browser compatibility for JSP pages.
9. Final Checklist
 All features are implemented and tested.
 Unit tests have 80%+ coverage for DAO and service layers.
 All known bugs are resolved.
 Security vulnerabilities are addressed.
 Deployment is tested in a production-like environment.
 Documentation is complete and up-to-date.
